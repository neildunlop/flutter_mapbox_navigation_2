/// Integration tests for verifying waypoint handling between Flutter and native platforms.

/// These tests verify that:
/// 1. Waypoints are correctly formatted when sent to the native platform
/// 2. The method channel correctly transmits waypoint data
/// 3. The data structure matches what the native platforms expect
/// 
/// Note: These tests don't actually run on the native platforms. They verify the
/// data format and transmission, but not the actual platform-specific implementation.
/// For true platform testing, we would need platform-specific integration tests
/// that run on actual Android/iOS devices or emulators.
